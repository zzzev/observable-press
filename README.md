# observable-press
An opinionated way to publish Observable notebooks.

## Goals
- Declarative
- No (or at least minimal) code outside of notebook
- Good defaults, minimal config
- Hide Observable machinery
- Add minimal additional weight

## Examples
To run the examples, clone the repository, and serve the files locally (for example, run `python -m http.server` from the root and then load http://0.0.0.0:8000/examples/trumpbits/).
